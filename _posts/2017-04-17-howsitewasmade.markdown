I chose to make the site using the Jekyll static site generator, on a Fedora 25 platform. A challenge I originally had was not being able to find a "Deploy to netlify" option under Frozen-Flask. After some research, I chose "Jekyll" since it seemed easy-to-learn and read some documentation on how to get started with it.

I installed Jekyll locally, and learned after some additional research that I needed to install the blankslate gem in order to get things rolling.
