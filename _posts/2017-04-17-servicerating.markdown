Using Netlify's StaticGen allowed me to quickly set up a Jekyll static site.

My two constructive feedback items:

1. A "Deploy to netlify" option under the Frozen-Flask static site generator.
2. After the site "goes live", a new tab could open up with a quickstart or getting started page for people new to using these Static Site Generators.
